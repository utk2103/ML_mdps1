## To deploy your project using streamlit

#### 1. Install Necessary Libraries:
Make sure to install the required libraries. If your model depends on any specific libraries, include them in your requirements.txt file.

```shell
pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn
```
#### 2. Create a Streamlit App Script:
Create a Streamlit app script (e.g., app.py) that loads your model and allows users to interact with it.

```shell
import streamlit as st
```

#### Load your trained model
model = joblib.load('your_model.joblib')  # Replace 'your_model.joblib' with the actual file path

##### Streamlit app
st.title('Your Machine Learning Model Deployment')


Prepare Model File:
Make sure to include your trained model file (your_model.joblib in this example) in your GitHub repository.

#### 3. Create a requirements.txt File:
List all the Python libraries required for your Streamlit app in a requirements.txt file.
```shell
streamlit==0.89.0
pandas==1.3.3
scikit-learn==0.24.2
```
GitHub Repository:
Upload your Streamlit app script (app.py), the trained model file (your_model.joblib), and the requirements.txt file to your GitHub repository.
